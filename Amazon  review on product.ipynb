I bought the phone because I was long overdue for an upgrade. My last phone was already kind of old when I bought it years ago. This phone is a fantastic little device. It does just about everything the high-end phones do for a quarter of the price. Between the 4K display and 64Mp camera, I can\\'t complain much! If I had to warn you about anything, it\\'s the slowmo feature. Yes, the slowmo works, but it only slows down the last quarter of a 10 second video. If you\\'re bad at math, that\\'s 2.5 seconds.The camera is phenomenal, though, and the phone is incredibly responsive. The display is gorgeous, the back of the phone is so pretty I decided on a clear case so as not to hide it. I\\'m afraid I\\'m going to break this thing, but I know it is absolutely worth more than they\\'re asking for it. Xiaomi did a fantastic job on the Redmi Note 9 Pro\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I had this phone for 4 days, and in those 4 days, my thoughts on it have changed. Day 1 the phone arrived and it\\'s lovely piece of equipment. I ordered the green, it\\'s a nice size and weight: the screen looked narrower  and shorter than my galaxy note 9,  but my galaxy fit into the redmi case, so...PROSScreen size is good for me.The phone has a good weight to it.Side fingerprint detection button is novel to me.The graphics for the games I play were good.It connected well with my at&t wifi.The overall look was pleasing to me.CONSI couldn\\'t get all my incoming calls. If callers didn\\'t leave a voice message or text, I would never have known they called.Call quality was poor. The people could barely hear me.The speaker(s) are subpar in my opinion. Not loud enough. You also definitely need a good equalizer on there.It literally took 45 seconds to hear the line ring after the number was dialed. On EVERY call I made.Honestly if the redmi would do the basic phone function (making and receiving calls), I\\'d consider keeping it. I don\\'t get a lot of people calling me every day but I expect that I can receive calls if they do come in, and an unlocked GSM  phone is expected to function properly with my carrier (t-mobile), so that was a deal breaker for me.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I love this phone it shouldn\\'t be $250 it is worth sooo much more than it even gets praise for the camera is of course not a full 64mp it stacks images to get there but it\\'s the cleanest 64mp camera I\\'ve ever seen under $500 it\\'s battery is amazing after I took it out of the box it lasted me 2 and a half days and I don\\'t have any problems with it it\\'s fingerprint reader is picky which is amazing that just means it\\'s not gonna let that much more error come in it\\'s just an all around great phone especially for gaming it can do whatever you want with little to no latency\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  El producto llego sin novedad funciona perfectamente aunque fue importado a Ecuador llego sin ningun da\\\\u00f1o, el empaquetado no fue el mejor pero no tuvo ning\\\\u00fan da\\\\u00f1o\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I like owning my phone but not paying a huge price. I bought a Samsung A70 I liked the phone but the finger print scanner was crap. So I tried going through Samsung for help I was told it\\'s a known issue but since I bought a universal phone it wasn\\'t covered. Then the screen broke and I was like YAY new phone time. I bought this phone after reading up on the reviews and comparing the specs. I recommend this phone 100 %. I can\\'t speak highly enough. It has a bright screen crystal clear. The camera is everything I want in a camera. It runs my Apps perfectly and games very well. Buy it!!\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  The hardware is good. Snapdragon 720G, 128GB + 6GB, 2400 x 1080 FHD+, 64MP camera, etc.Major issue is that Xiaomi decided to take a dump on all those, and equip the phone with bad iPhone knock off Launcher that totally lacks affinity with Android. Bloatware they put on the phone make it even worse as you cannot even hide them without using bloatware of their own as the launcher lacks basic stock functionalities.It\\'s just ridiculous to replace stock software with inferior home brew bloatware/flexware. I wish they understand that Android phone buyers actually want Android phones, not a knock off iPhone.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Es un celular excelente por el precio, buena inversion si no tienes un redmi 8 pro. No me gusto la camara porque sobresale del celular pero con una  carcaza ya no se nota. Funciona rapido, toma buenas fotos, le dura mucho la bateria, pantalla gigante. Tardare buen tiempo con este celular.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  So I actually LOVE this phone but unfortunately the few issues I\\'ve been having with it area deal breakers so I am returning it.The good:The camera is AMAZING. Seriously if I could get past the calling issues, I would keep it for this feature alone.The screen is bright and crisp and had phenomenal color display.The battery is top notch - one charge lasted me 2.5 days of moderate to high use.The bad:The screen phantom touches sometimes when you haven\\'t actually touched the screen (like if you hover, it thinks you tapped, which can be pretty annoying).The deal breaker:It\\'s not supported by most carriers in my area. Verizon and Tmobile would not accept the IMEI and would not guarantee device would work on their networks because it\\'s a global/international version, and not made for the US. AT&T said it would work based on IMEI so I ordered their SIM and put it in my old iphone 7 until my Redmi arrived (note: the SIM gave me 3 bars of LTE coverage on the iphone)... Insert it into the Redmi and it immediately dropped to one bar of service and intermittently would lose service completely. I thought I could get over the crummy service, but after I activated the wifi calling (per instructions I found online) I still wasn\\'t able to receive calls while at home. I spent HOURS on the phone with both AT&T tech support and Amazon\\'s support feature, but it still won\\'t make or receive calls over wifi.. because of this, and the fact it is diminishing my  cell reception, I can\\'t make or receive calls about 60-75% of the time. That IS a deal breaker for me, so it\\'s back in the box and going back unfortunately.Wish they would make a US model already!!\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  The phone takes 5-6 hours to be charged completely, whereas online reviews say it should take only about 2 hours. Also, the battery life is very short. I am afraid that this is a fake version.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  So far so good. Swapping out my existing phone on Metro was okay. Huge warnings on package that this device will not work on Verizon-type carriers and to return phone right away without opening, so all the Verizon whiners shouldn\\'t be moaning about this - they were warned. There are two sim slots, use the slot closest to the memory card, as that will be your first IMEI number on the back of the phone. The fingerprint reader is built into the power button, which is nifty. Display looks fine and speed is fine as well. Camera seems alright but I need to mess with that more. I was tired of slower phones with 4g ram and slower cpus, this phone has the 6g ram and a spry 720 Snapdragon, which checks off those two boxes for me. The price is far less than a Samsung. 8/29 update - One downer I have found is that this phone does not support wireless calling. womp womp UPDATE 4/11/21 - Phone has had no issues, performance has been fine. I recommend this phone if you are looking for a quality phone at this price point.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  This thing is my absolute favorite.

Day 1 the phone arrived and it\\'s lovely piece of equipment. I ordered the green, it\\'s a nice size and weight: the screen looked narrower  and shorter than my galaxy note 9,  but my galaxy fit into the redmi case, so...PROSScreen size is good for me.The phone has a good weight to it.Side fingerprint detection button is novel to me.The graphics for the games I play were good.It connected well with my at&t wifi.The overall look was pleasing to me.CONSI couldn\\'t get all my incoming calls. If callers didn\\'t leave a voice message or text, I would never have known they called.Call quality was poor. The people could barely hear me.The speaker(s) are subpar in my opinion. Not loud enough. You also definitely need a good equalizer on there.It literally took 45 seconds to hear the line ring after the number was dialed. On EVERY call I made.Honestly if the redmi would do the basic phone function (making and receiving calls), I\\'d consider keeping it. I don\\'t get a lot of people calling me every day but I expect that I can receive calls if they do come in, and an unlocked GSM  phone is expected to function properly with my carrier (t-mobile), so that was a deal breaker for me.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I love this phone it shouldn\\'t be $250 it is worth sooo much more than it even gets praise for the camera is of course not a full 64mp it stacks images to get there but it\\'s the cleanest 64mp camera I\\'ve ever seen under $500 it\\'s battery is amazing after I took it out of the box it lasted me 2 and a half days and I don\\'t have any problems with it it\\'s fingerprint reader is picky which is amazing that just means it\\'s not gonna let that much more error come in it\\'s just an all around great phone especially for gaming it can do whatever you want with little to no latency\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  El producto llego sin novedad funciona perfectamente aunque fue importado a Ecuador llego sin ningun da\\\\u00f1o, el empaquetado no fue el mejor pero no tuvo ning\\\\u00fan da\\\\u00f1o\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I like owning my phone but not paying a huge price. I bought a Samsung A70 I liked the phone but the finger print scanner was crap. So I tried going through Samsung for help I was told it\\'s a known issue but since I bought a universal phone it wasn\\'t covered. Then the screen broke and I was like YAY new phone time. I bought this phone after reading up on the reviews and comparing the specs. I recommend this phone 100 %. I can\\'t speak highly enough. It has a bright screen crystal clear. The camera is everything I want in a camera. It runs my Apps perfectly and games very well. Buy it!!\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  The hardware is good. Snapdragon 720G, 128GB + 6GB, 2400 x 1080 FHD+, 64MP camera, etc.Major issue is that Xiaomi decided to take a dump on all those, and equip the phone with bad iPhone knock off Launcher that totally lacks affinity with Android. Bloatware they put on the phone make it even worse as you cannot even hide them without using bloatware of their own as the launcher lacks basic stock functionalities.It\\'s just ridiculous to replace stock software with inferior home brew bloatware/flexware. I wish they understand that Android phone buyers actually want Android phones, not a knock off iPhone.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Es un celular excelente por el precio, buena inversion si no tienes un redmi 8 pro. No me gusto la camara porque sobresale del celular pero con una  carcaza ya no se nota. Funciona rapido, toma buenas fotos, le dura mucho la bateria, pantalla gigante. Tardare buen tiempo con este celular.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  So I actually LOVE this phone but unfortunately the few issues I\\'ve been having with it area deal breakers so I am returning it.The good:The camera is AMAZING. Seriously if I could get past the calling issues, I would keep it for this feature alone.The screen is bright and crisp and had phenomenal color display.The battery is top notch - one charge lasted me 2.5 days of moderate to high use.The bad:The screen phantom touches sometimes when you haven\\'t actually touched the screen (like if you hover, it thinks you tapped, which can be pretty annoying).The deal breaker:It\\'s not supported by most carriers in my area. Verizon and Tmobile would not accept the IMEI and would not guarantee device would work on their networks because it\\'s a global/international version, and not made for the US. AT&T said it would work based on IMEI so I ordered their SIM and put it in my old iphone 7 until my Redmi arrived (note: the SIM gave me 3 bars of LTE coverage on the iphone)... Insert it into the Redmi and it immediately dropped to one bar of service and intermittently would lose service completely. I thought I could get over the crummy service, but after I activated the wifi calling (per instructions I found online) I still wasn\\'t able to receive calls while at home. I spent HOURS on the phone with both AT&T tech support and Amazon\\'s support feature, but it still won\\'t make or receive calls over wifi.. because of this, and the fact it is diminishing my  cell reception, I can\\'t make or receive calls about 60-75% of the time. That IS a deal breaker for me, so it\\'s back in the box and going back unfortunately.Wish they would make a US model already!!\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  The phone takes 5-6 hours to be charged completely, whereas online reviews say it should take only about 2 hours. Also, the battery life is very short. I am afraid that this is a fake version.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  So far so good. Swapping out my existing phone on Metro was okay. Huge warnings on package that this device will not work on Verizon-type carriers and to return phone right away without opening, so all the Verizon whiners shouldn\\'t be moaning about this - they were warned. There are two sim slots, use the slot closest to the memory card, as that will be your first IMEI number on the back of the phone. The fingerprint reader is built into the power button, which is nifty. Display looks fine and speed is fine as well. Camera seems alright but I need to mess with that more. I was tired of slower phones with 4g ram and slower cpus, this phone has the 6g ram and a spry 720 Snapdragon, which checks off those two boxes for me. The price is far less than a Samsung. 8/29 update - One downer I have found is that this phone does not support wireless calling. womp womp UPDATE 4/11/21 - Phone has had no issues, performance has been fine. I recommend this phone if you are looking for a quality phone at this price point.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Fast Shipping, shipped brand new in the package. Mine came with a clear case, also came with a European charger only, which is okay, I have a USA spare charger.Other than that, Amazing phone! It\\'s beautiful, not to big, but it IS heavy.Carrier: I have T-Mobile (Wingalpha.com) - I was a bit worried that it wouldn\\'t work with my service. But it did! My anxiety was gone once I put my SIM in and set it up and it worked flawless.Definitely recommend!P.s- it comes with a pre-installed screen protector. I normally don\\'t like them but I haven\\'t noticed any issues with it; so it\\'s not a big deal.Update: it\\'s been almost 6 months with the phone. Still no issues what so ever! Still love it!\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  From a loyal LG customer, last was the LG V30 with amazing sound, video and camera quality.  But the ram, memory and battery life started lacking.  The Note 9 Pro beats it in spades.  Battery life is the best part of the phone.  I\\'ve had used it 3 days straight with mobile data constantly on before recharging.  Never spent more than $300 on a phone as I always buy one or two generations behind.But it\\'s not without its quirks.  And it may be unfair to compare it to the 3 year old LG V30.Firstly it\\'s a Chinese phone so there may be a security risk.  Lately I\\'ve had emails from Venmo about unauthorized sign-ins since using the phone.  But that could be another data breach.Secondly, the UI is very basic.  MIUI on android 10 is not very customizable.  From a 3 year old Flagship LG V30 the Note 9 Pro is lacking.  Can\\'t control game graphics and frame rate like the V30 running on android 9.  But it\\'s moot since the battery is so big.  One cool feature is running 2 apps in split screen top/bottom and 50/50 or 66/33 or 33/66 size.  The V30 was able to do that.  But you can drag an app out and have it float on a corner as a window.  Also can\\'t change the aspect ratio or the resolution of the screenThirdly, even though it\\'s unlocked you have to make sure your carrier bands are supported.  I\\'m with T-Mobile and most bands are supported but still had to create a custom APN (look it up) to send/receive txts and mms txts.  The APN on my sim card was not fully compatible.  Also if I don\\'t keep mobile data on there\\'s no guarantee of incoming/outgoing calls.  But come January 2021 T-Mobile subscribers will only be able to make VoLTE calls.  I also seem to get 3G speeds even though LTE is indicated is connected and indicated on status bar.  If you dig around settings you can see downstream speeds on status bar.  Wifi is no issue.Fourthly, no wifi calling.  Looked everywhere but can\\'t seem to find it.  And can\\'t send/receive txts over wifi which my old phone could do in case I didn\\'t have a cell signal.Fifth, minor things like the screen aspect ratio is too tall, 20:9 I think.  And it\\'s LCD not OLED like my old phone.  Light does bleed thru on top right hand corner.  Battery life and brightness is not an issue because the battery is big.  I still prefer OLED for better blacks and grays and no light bleeding.Sixth, transferring apps and accounts is not as seamless as with LG.  Every generation LG phone allowed me to transfer and restore all my apps, accounts, email and settings with little follow up thru it\\'s mobile app.  It\\'s the main reason I stuck with LG for so long.  On the Redmi I was only able to transfer and restore my Google account and some apps.  Had to sign in to most of my accounts again unlike the seamlessness of LG app/account restore process.I know I\\'ve focused on the negatives but the positives speak for themselves.  For instance the rear camera is amazing at 64 mp and you can record 4k video if you have the memory.Conclusion, this will be my holdover phone until I upgrade to a 5G.  Either it will be another Redmi or I\\'ll go back to LG when the price is right.Edit: 12-16-20.  Forgot to mention no wireless charging and it\\'s not waterproof, the V30 has it.  But there is a headphone jack.Side note, when I read reviews I usually read the bad reviews first that\\'s why the review skews negative but it isn\\'t so.  There are many features that are not covered more readily explained from other reviews so I won\\'t be repeating them.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  So I was a little nervous ordering this phone, as I\\'ve had a Samsung Note phone for the last 5 years. I was honestly tired of paying $1k per phone,so I started researching more affordable alternatives and came across Xiaomi Redmi and read all the great reviews and decided to give it\\'s go.  I can definitely say, I am not at all disappointed in my decision. I\\'m quite happy I got this phone, it can definitely go head to head with any top notch phone and gives Samsung a run for their money. I will never buy another Samsung with this far better alternative. The specs, quality and camera... all you get for a 1/4 of the price. Thank you Xiaomi!! You are the Robin Hood of premium phones for the poor and the frugal.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  So far I am really pleased with this phone. I wanted a phone that I would be able to get notifications, with nice camera, decent storage and great battery life. It has it all.

Camera is fantastic needs some improvement though by software update. Battery life is tooooooo loooooong. Lasts for 3days of Moderate usage.Cons: speaker is like a joke. It sounds like a cheap Chinese radio.The most important thing i\\'d like to mention that xiaomi said now they have a new improved vibration motor for better haptic feedback but  on that one is worse than ever. . Even for more now they have removed the option to adjust vibration intensity  like soft , medium to hi tapping on the screen. So there is no way to adjust haptic feedback strength.

If you want to know exactly what version it is, the \\\\\"About phone\\\\\" menu says the MIUI version isVersion: V11.0.4.0.QJZEUXM (MIUI11)According to the c.mi.com, this makes the phone a Redmi Note 9 Pro EEA.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I bought Xiaomi Redmi note 9 and Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 pro 2 phones, as a tablet, they are great, with large capacity batteries, fast processor is very comfortable to use. As a phone, completely unqualified. I USE T-Mobile network, I used to  have normal phone signals at home, but  this phone reception signal was very weak in my home .Many times I cannot make and receive calls at home. When the phone is connected, it is often intermittent. sometimes the call is automatically interrupted.  What I want is a phone, not a tablet.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  The phone is a very good value for the money and punches well above its price point, but in some ways, you get what you pay for.The good: Great battery life, large screen, good cameras, smooth UI, very quick.The bad: The screen could be better, it\\'s slightly dark and the colors don\\'t quite pop like on true flagship phones. By far the biggest issue though is the frequent wifi outages. Sometimes wifi shows connected, sometimes disconnected, but I can expect wifi to stop working every 30 minutes or so. It happens across all wifi networks, factory reset didn\\'t fix it, updated miui didn\\'t fix it either. If you don\\'t have unlimited data, beware.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I originally bought a xiaomi phone in January 2018 to replace my non-uogradeable Blu Pure XL. Xioami phone was light-years better. Unfortunately a shattered screen meant having to buy a new phone. I went with xiaomi Note 9 pro  global (US edition only it seems was available). It is a sad comparison to my old xiaomi. The one gesture I relied on most was the  native phone recording which made crystal clear  recordings of the conversation automatically. This feature is not available in the US version, apparently the is to Google and what I assume a  lobbying campaign to stifle their Chinese competition. Further evidence  to indicate this is that xiaomi phone users were left with Google.srticlrs to install Google\\'s \\\\\"native\\\\\" call support which really only activates the sound recorder and catches only YOUR voice with a faint whisper  of the caller you can barely hear as the recorder is in the mouth piece and tries to hear the caller which is heard through the ear piece of the phone, the same failed recording option I had on my Blu Pure Xl. Also, the camera which hails as being better than my previous Xiaomi phone isn\\'t. Save your money, just buy a comparable low end American phone.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  The Redmi Note 9 Pro was a decent phone in other respects (before I had to return it), but save your time trying to enable Wifi calling--the option is absent from the settings, where you\\'d find it on other Android phones.  I found a roundabout way to check that VoWifi was enabled, but apparently this is different from T-Mobile\\'s Wifi Calling (at least in the U.S.?). The T-Mobile tech staff was unable to help. I\\'ve read that this phone\\'s VoWifi works with some international carriers--Jio and AirTel.  Considering this is advertised as an unlocked, T-Mobile compatible phone, it should be made clear that Wifi calling through T-Mobile in the U.S. doesn\\'t work.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  It\\'s work alright, but don\\'t meet my expectations. The screen kind of hurt my eye when i use it longer, And its too big! My finger can\\'t control whole screen when i play Moba game. System is way more better than my old android phone, but it get stuck once in first 3 days.Update:After I Start Return. It Took 2 Weeks To Get Part Of Money Back . Around $50 Short From Original Price. Will Give 0 Star If I Can. The Screen Getting Bad And They Steal Your $50 For That, Terrible.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I absolutely love this phone. Where do I start? It has specs which rival the flagship models of any brand out there, including the Samsung Note 20+ (although it has very little in common with the Note series - no stylus for one - so the name is misleading). 6 gigs of RAM, Octacore processor, a 64mb (!!!) quad lens camera that shoots beautiful, high resolution photos, 2 sim card slots, expandable memory via a MicroSD card slot, a huge, nearly bezel-less/infinity screen (not curved like the Note or S series but that didn\\'t bother me, despite being a Samsung geek for the last ten years), and a HUGE 5000mAh battery (I can wake up with a full charge and wring this things neck all day - browsing the web, watching YouTube, watching a movie or 2 on Prime or Netflix, doing whatever else constitutes being \\\\\"glued to your phone all day\\\\\"... By the time the day is through I will typically have 20-30% of battery life remaining whereas my Note8 (3000mAh) required being on the charger several times throughout. As expected due to the impressive specs the phone is extremely fast.. It reboots completely in seconds, there\\'s no noticeable lag when opening / closing apps (including apps that tax the RAM and processor such as HD games, video players etc) as well as when multiple apps are running in the background.There aren\\'t many cons and none are deal breakers, espec at this price, but it\\'s worth mentioning that the phone is very heavy and the back is *somewhat* bulky. It\\'s possible I\\'ve just been spoiled by the all glass construction of the later Samsung Note models, for all I know it\\'s weight and bulk is consistent with the flagship models of most other brands. I only mention the weight and bulk *relative to the Note 8 I\\'ve been using for 3 years*.. After a week of using it I am not bothered by either.TL;DR - This is a powerful device that can go toe to toe with any other brand\\'s flagship  for only $240. The camera, screen, and battery life are second to none. It\\'s doubtful that you\\'ll find it\\'s equal for under $800, and it absolutely destroys anything in it\\'s price point. But don\\'t buy it because it\\'s \\\\\"cheap\\\\\", buy it because it\\'s a fantastic device and an incredible value.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Not sure why but Amazon links will sometimes open in google browser and sometimes open in the app. not only that, the amazon app will always give me an error saying \\\\\"oops, something went wrong\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Upgrading from a Xiaomi Mi A1 and this has so many features.  Not a fan of stock apps so I debloated (google it) and everything is running smoothly.  The camera is so versatile!  The video stabilization is great, zoom looks awesome until about 5x but can actually go out to 0.6x which is awesome for those wide scenic views.  The macro camera is very cool, and the phone supports GCam so you can get time lapse and photo spheres as well.  My only gripe is the stock apps but they were easy to remove.  Great value for the price, 4G working great on Lycamobile (Tmobile MVNO).\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Worth every penny. You can\\'t expect the experience like samsung or Apple  from a 250 bucks phone. But at this price you won\\'t be disappointed too. Although it is equipped with an IPS lcd display honestly i found it as equal to an amoled panels. Camera is fantastic needs some improvement though by software update. Battery life is tooooooo loooooong. Lasts for 3days of Moderate usage.Cons: speaker is like a joke. It sounds like a cheap Chinese radio.The most important thing i\\'d like to mention that xiaomi said now they have a new improved vibration motor for better haptic feedback but  on that one is worse than ever. . Even for more now they have removed the option to adjust vibration intensity  like soft , medium to hi tapping on the screen. So there is no way to adjust haptic feedback strength. All you have to stuck with default and it\\'s seriously annoying.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Overall, I am pleased with this phone, however, the description of it as an \\\\\"International version\\\\\" is not very precise. If you want to know exactly what version it is, the \\\\\"About phone\\\\\" menu says the MIUI version isVersion: V11.0.4.0.QJZEUXM (MIUI11)According to the c.mi.com, this makes the phone a Redmi Note 9 Pro EEA.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I bought Xiaomi Redmi note 9 and Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 pro 2 phones, as a tablet, they are great, with large capacity batteries, fast processor is very comfortable to use. As a phone, completely unqualified. I USE T-Mobile network, I used to  have normal phone signals at home, but  this phone reception signal was very weak in my home .Many times I cannot make and receive calls at home. When the phone is connected, it is often intermittent. sometimes the call is automatically interrupted.  What I want is a phone, not a tablet.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  The phone is a very good value for the money and punches well above its price point, but in some ways, you get what you pay for.The good: Great battery life, large screen, good cameras, smooth UI, very quick.The bad: The screen could be better, it\\'s slightly dark and the colors don\\'t quite pop like on true flagship phones. By far the biggest issue though is the frequent wifi outages. Sometimes wifi shows connected, sometimes disconnected, but I can expect wifi to stop working every 30 minutes or so. It happens across all wifi networks, factory reset didn\\'t fix it, updated miui didn\\'t fix it either. If you don\\'t have unlimited data, beware.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I originally bought a xiaomi phone in January 2018 to replace my non-uogradeable Blu Pure XL. Xioami phone was light-years better. Unfortunately a shattered screen meant having to buy a new phone. I went with xiaomi Note 9 pro  global (US edition only it seems was available). It is a sad comparison to my old xiaomi. The one gesture I relied on most was the  native phone recording which made crystal clear  recordings of the conversation automatically. This feature is not available in the US version, apparently the is to Google and what I assume a  lobbying campaign to stifle their Chinese competition. Further evidence  to indicate this is that xiaomi phone users were left with Google.srticlrs to install Google\\'s \\\\\"native\\\\\" call support which really only activates the sound recorder and catches only YOUR voice with a faint whisper  of the caller you can barely hear as the recorder is in the mouth piece and tries to hear the caller which is heard through the ear piece of the phone, the same failed recording option I had on my Blu Pure Xl. Also, the camera which hails as being better than my previous Xiaomi phone isn\\'t. Save your money, just buy a comparable low end American phone.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  The Redmi Note 9 Pro was a decent phone in other respects (before I had to return it), but save your time trying to enable Wifi calling--the option is absent from the settings, where you\\'d find it on other Android phones.  I found a roundabout way to check that VoWifi was enabled, but apparently this is different from T-Mobile\\'s Wifi Calling (at least in the U.S.?). The T-Mobile tech staff was unable to help. I\\'ve read that this phone\\'s VoWifi works with some international carriers--Jio and AirTel.  Considering this is advertised as an unlocked, T-Mobile compatible phone, it should be made clear that Wifi calling through T-Mobile in the U.S. doesn\\'t work.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  It\\'s work alright, but don\\'t meet my expectations. The screen kind of hurt my eye when i use it longer, And its too big! My finger can\\'t control whole screen when i play Moba game. System is way more better than my old android phone, but it get stuck once in first 3 days.Update:After I Start Return. It Took 2 Weeks To Get Part Of Money Back . Around $50 Short From Original Price. Will Give 0 Star If I Can. The Screen Getting Bad And They Steal Your $50 For That, Terrible.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I absolutely love this phone. Where do I start? It has specs which rival the flagship models of any brand out there, including the Samsung Note 20+ (although it has very little in common with the Note series - no stylus for one - so the name is misleading). 6 gigs of RAM, Octacore processor, a 64mb (!!!) quad lens camera that shoots beautiful, high resolution photos, 2 sim card slots, expandable memory via a MicroSD card slot, a huge, nearly bezel-less/infinity screen (not curved like the Note or S series but that didn\\'t bother me, despite being a Samsung geek for the last ten years), and a HUGE 5000mAh battery (I can wake up with a full charge and wring this things neck all day - browsing the web, watching YouTube, watching a movie or 2 on Prime or Netflix, doing whatever else constitutes being \\\\\"glued to your phone all day\\\\\"... By the time the day is through I will typically have 20-30% of battery life remaining whereas my Note8 (3000mAh) required being on the charger several times throughout. As expected due to the impressive specs the phone is extremely fast.. It reboots completely in seconds, there\\'s no noticeable lag when opening / closing apps (including apps that tax the RAM and processor such as HD games, video players etc) as well as when multiple apps are running in the background.There aren\\'t many cons and none are deal breakers, espec at this price, but it\\'s worth mentioning that the phone is very heavy and the back is *somewhat* bulky. It\\'s possible I\\'ve just been spoiled by the all glass construction of the later Samsung Note models, for all I know it\\'s weight and bulk is consistent with the flagship models of most other brands. I only mention the weight and bulk *relative to the Note 8 I\\'ve been using for 3 years*.. After a week of using it I am not bothered by either.TL;DR - This is a powerful device that can go toe to toe with any other brand\\'s flagship  for only $240. The camera, screen, and battery life are second to none. It\\'s doubtful that you\\'ll find it\\'s equal for under $800, and it absolutely destroys anything in it\\'s price point. But don\\'t buy it because it\\'s \\\\\"cheap\\\\\", buy it because it\\'s a fantastic device and an incredible value.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Not sure why but Amazon links will sometimes open in google browser and sometimes open in the app. not only that, the amazon app will always give me an error saying \\\\\"oops, something went wrong\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Upgrading from a Xiaomi Mi A1 and this has so many features.  Not a fan of stock apps so I debloated (google it) and everything is running smoothly.  The camera is so versatile!  The video stabilization is great, zoom looks awesome until about 5x but can actually go out to 0.6x which is awesome for those wide scenic views.  The macro camera is very cool, and the phone supports GCam so you can get time lapse and photo spheres as well.  My only gripe is the stock apps but they were easy to remove.  Great value for the price, 4G working great on Lycamobile (Tmobile MVNO).\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I\\\\u2019ve had this phone for 3 days now and that is good enough to provide an initial impression.In summary, this is a great piece of tech available at a very reasonable price.  But let me elaborate so that people reading this review can form their own opinionsFirst, I will talk about the looks and the build quality  It is great, the back in particular is so good looking and it reflects light differently at various angles.  Both front and back come with gorilla glass 5 so that should be durable, the front looks very clean and neat.  If I have to find a fault, the only one I can think of is that the side rim is made out of plastic, it is not metal.  First of all, it\\\\u2019s not easy to notice it. Secondly, it shouldn\\\\u2019t cause much concern since the phone still appears to be very sturdy and premium.  Overall, good build quality for the price.Screen quality and brightness  The screen is IPS LCD so obviously it doesn\\\\u2019t have the deep blacks like an AMOLED screen.  It doesn\\\\u2019t even have the kind of contrast that AMOLES has.  But, overall it is still a very high quality screen.  For comparison, I used iPhone XR which has an IPS LCD display and it matches or actually slightly beats it in my opinion.  Outdoor visibility is also very good because it has more than decent brightness.  So again, for the price, this is good.Software and Performance  It comes with a Android version 9 out of the box and it installs a security update immediately after booting up for the first time.  Yes Android 10 is out now and we should ideally have that.  Hopefully, we would get Android 10 on this phone soon through Mi UI new version.  But none of this takes away the software experience.  It is good, it is smooth and nice.  So far I haven\\\\u2019t experienced any slowness or lags.  It is doing a good job.  I installed poco installer which has been very helpful as it is better than Mi UI and has an app drawer which Mi UI doesn\\\\u2019t.Performance is also good, it comes with a dedicated game mode that you can use to bump up the performance while playing games.  Overall, very snappy and can play performance intensive games like subway surfers and asphalt easily.  People have complained it heats up. I have noticed even iPhones heating up when you play such games so it\\\\u2019s not really a concernCameras  It comes with 4 different cameras at the back with the primary one being 64 MP.  I haven\\\\u2019t used the cameras as much yet but have been able to try portrait mode, regular mode, 64 MP mode, wide angle mode and night time photography.  You can say that it is not at par with google or iPhone or Samsung phones but again for the price it is quite good.  Especially the wide angle camera has a nice field of view which allows it to take some great photos.  I just snapped a picture of 40 people standing in a group from up close using wide angle camera and it came out very nice.  For night time, the camera takes some time to take a snap as it is gathering as much light as possible to bring out a nice photo.  So overall it is very good. Happy with the pictures so far.  I have iPhone XS Max and it doesn\\\\u2019t have wide angle and night mode so getting those capabilities here has been good.  Also, the portrait mode is good and it produces good quality images with good blur effect and reasonably good edge detection.  Regarding the selfie camera, the performance  seemed ok, not great. It gives a bit of an artificial effect which is not preferred.  But that\\\\u2019s the only issue I have been able to find so farConnectivity to network  I have T-mobile and this phone works flawlessly on this network. Upload / download speed are very good.  On WiFi you it works very well.Battery and charging speedIt comes with a monster 4500 mAmp battery and damn it is good.  I have already reached screen on time of almost 6 hours and have more than 20% left.  I have done everything, played heavy games, watched a lot of YouTube videos, made phone calls, sent messages, browsed web.  You get an 18W charger in the box but I haven\\\\u2019t been able to use it as it\\\\u2019s not a North American charger.  I used another 27W charger that came with the Essential phone and charging speed is excellent.Other additions  There are a few other things that this phone brings in which possibly other phones don\\\\u2019t .  IR blaster, I used it and it works flawlessly on Samsung TVs.  It also has micro SD expansion slot which I intend to use very soon with fast storage and retrieval.  It comes with a case which is good and you don\\\\u2019t need to buy it separately before the phone arrives.And lastly it comes with a 3.5 mm headphone jack which is also great. Hardly any phones come ms with this now  a days.Overall very happy with the way this phone is shaping up, until nowPlease see some pictures of the phone for better insights\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I upgraded to this phone from a 4 year old mid level phone.  My biggest issue with that one was battery life, so that was a big consideration for me in my new device.  After doing a bunch of searching here on Amazon for an unlocked device, I found this one to have the best combination of cost to feature, after doing plenty of research on the processor.I\\'ve had the unit for a little over a month now, and I can say I am very pleased with the performance and battery life on this phone.  I am not a heavy user of my cell phone as my main media consumption device, and with my personal average use, a 100% charge will last me up to 3 days.  My previous phone was a daily charger.The size of the screen is great, even if it doesn\\'t have the best brightness or contrast, for most people it\\'s going to be good enough.  Same with the camera setup, while not absolutely the best thing ever, it is excellent and takes very clear shots.  The speaker is loud enough for normal use, and the other audio options (Bluetooth and Headphone Jack) have good output as well.  The interface is fast, and feels snappy under normal use.I am is the US on the AT&T network, and had no issues setting up the phone with the micro sim from my previous phone, and didn\\'t have to do anything special to get the unit setup and working.  There is some bloatware on the phone that you can\\'t remove, but you can ignore, which I would suggest.  I would recommend this device to anyone that doesn\\'t \\'need\\' a flagship or apple device.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  There was nothing good about this phone.The Android was completely modified to a point where you can no longer control your device. This phone is filled with bloatware that prevents you from doing centain things and you can\\'t remove any of the bloatware apps, which you have to use.If you want to unlock or enable USB app installation because you are a developer then good luck. You will have to create an account with Xiaomi then register your sim card using your mobile data and have GPS on so they can find your home location. This sounds very sketchy and illegal. They\\'re definitely something\\'s going on with this phone manufacturer. Anytime you want to get the direct system log access it makes you go through bunch of hoops as if they are hiding something.If you are a long time Android user then stay away from Xiaomi phones. After 2019 they completely changed the whole Android OS system in to a black box that logs your activity.If you want to unlock your phone then good luck. Even with creating an account and going through all the steps you still won\\'t be able to unlock your phone. And the worst part is the phone makes you wait 7 days every time you fail to try again. A lot has changed with this company to  point it is no longer the company you once know. I was able unlock OnePlus 3, 5T, 7T, Google pixel 2, Asus Zen Phone etc.. but not this phone.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Everything checks out. The IMEI # is legit. Got here a full week before the arrival date unscratched and gorgeous. If you\\'re from Puerto Rico and you\\'re wondering if it works with Claro, it does. Provided you get the international version. This phone is utterly gorgeous. I love it. + No forced bloatware. Witch is awesome. The only bummer is that it came with the European charging brick. Not the U.S. one. But I honestly don\\'t care that much about that last part since I have other charging bricks. The phone is great. Get it if you can . The pics I posted i took with the camera of the phone.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  This phone is a beast! I cannot believe the price because I can match this up against my daughter\\'s brand new Samsung feature for feature.Came beautifully packaged and ready to go right out of the box. I took the card out of my old phone and popped it in and it was ready to go.If you\\'re on the fence do not hesitate. It is a beautiful phone and works like the most high-end brand.I love it!!!\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Wish I could give this zero stars.I was so excited upon receiving this phone as it\\'s such a good deal and seemed really good quality.A few days after good use, the phone started malfunctioning. It started freezing, and then shutting itself off saying \\\\\"this device is corrupted.\\\\\"And then turning itself back on and then freezing again and then repeating the process etc, over and over again.I\\'m so annoyed, now I won\\'t have a phone for another week.Unfortunately, this phone is a piece of garbage.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  This cell phone is the best I have ever had in my life. I used to have Samsung cell phone before years ago so as other brand name phones I\\'ve got from T-Mobile and these worked exactly for a year and were not usable right when the warranty was expiring.I got tired of this and bought my first  off-brand cell phone - ZTE ZMAX - it was a great phone for 2015, much better than Samsung I had prior to it for the fraction of the cost! It worked for 2 years until the battery got fully discharged and I wasn\\'t able to charge it ever again. I then bought Huawei Honor 6x and had it for 3 years. It worked just fine until it started acting with major delays, so I knew it was time to get a new phone.After multiple hours of research I decided to go with Remi Note 8. Thanks to \\\\\"frequency check\\\\\" site I knew I had to get a Global version. I highly recommend to check the phone model and your provider to see how many bands will be supported. I have T-Mobile and any International Version of this phone wasn\\'t working for T-Mobile LTE.Unfortunately Amazon didn\\'t have any Global versions of Redmi Note 8 in stock, so I wend with less memory and Redmi Not 8 Pro. It looks like I overpaid a little because overall prices were high (I blame coronavirus for that lol), but let me tell you - I didn\\'t regret my decision even once because Redmi Note 8 Pro is AMAZING!It feels great - solid, nice, works smooth! I just love it.It takes great pictures. Not as great (real looking) as my Canon Mark II takes, but much better than other phones. Selfies are also great.  The connection is the same as I had with Honor 6x (which supported more LTE bands by the way). I experienced a lost of connection while driving on Interstate as well as in multiple story office building, but it didn\\'t bother me as it happened few times really.The screen feels great to touch. The colors are amazing. Fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone works like a charm. Face recognition feature also works great. Fast browser. Battery life is also great, but my old Honor 6x was giving me full day of usage on one charge. I understand this phone is a huge upgrade from Honor 6x overall because it\\'s been 3 years between these phones which is a huge time frame in technical world, but Redmi Note 9 Pro amazes me every day and I am not even using it to full capacity.I\\'ve got 64 gb one as the price difference for about $45 between this and 128 gb didn\\'t do it for me. I am getting extra memory card which will last me for the duration of this phone\\'s life. After all my old Honor 6x had 32 gb and 64 gm external card and I still was good on memory after 3 years on regular usage.My only doubt is the color. I\\'ve got it in forest green and it\\'s beautiful, but I wanted it in white. Unfortunately the description for white didn\\'t indicate it\\'s a Global version so I wend with green. It still looks pretty cool! Included silicone cover is a bonus. My charger came without US adapter, so I ended up buying 2 for around $5 and now have capability of charging my phone super fast.If you still thinking of buying it... considering newer Redmi Note is about to be announced, don\\'t waste time - this phone is pretty amazing! Hoping it will last for few years.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Great phone for the price. At first I bought an Umidigi budget phone but that did not adequately meet my needs so it was returned. This phone has everything I need for the price. The only thing I took a star off was because the charger is European version and I really expected the phone to already have a screen protector installed like most budget or overseas unlocked phone. The one I got did not, and I don\\'t really feel like having to dish another $10 bucks or so to order a screen protector when the standard has been pre-installed on most or all phones like this. Maybe someone got lazy overseas and did not put one on but now I have to search for one on Amazon and hope that my screen will be okay in the meanwhile.The phone is fast, looks really amazing (I love the green color--I\\'ve never seen this color before on cellphones), and the MIUI is actually not bad even without an app drawer. I do have the Prime Nova Launcher already purchased so eventually I will revert to that launcher but right now just checking out Redmi\\'s MIUI for a feel of it. Right out of the box there was an update to 11 from 10 (I assume the MIUI update). It was a seemless update. So far the signal is good with TMobile for my area and multimedia like Netflix is really snappy and bright. The screen and ratio is good for videos. Haven\\'t tried the camera yet as I am not really a camera person. Will use it eventually and update my review overall in a few weeks or so.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  This phone is amazing for the price. The fingerprint reader is extremely snappy, scrolling is buttery smooth, and it\\'s lightning fast. Not to mention it\\'s a beautiful piece of tech. I got the green model. My service is with Cricket Wireless in rural Maryland and I\\'m getting all 5 bars of 4G LTE. I\\'m truly impressed by this phone and would recommend it to anyone looking for a $220 phone with $750 specs. I\\'m a happy camper.Update: After a few weeks using this phone I must say that it gets more amazing every day. I keep finding features while exploring the settings. I wasn\\'t expecting an app drawer but in the settings there is an app drawer option. I\\'m still a happy camper.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  First Chinese phone other than a flagship Samsung and iPhone in over 6 years. couldn\\'t be happier with this Redmi Note 8 Pro. Feels sleek in my hands, easy to navigate, not a ton of bloat ware, and battery lasts over 24 hours in between charges at least for the week I\\'ve had it.It\\'s running Android 9.0 and has already received 1 system update which is nice moving forward. The camera is better than my old Samsung Galaxy 8 which is saying quite a bit.The DDR is 6gb which is less than the newest Galaxy 10 at 8gb, but this phone is blazing fast.

I cannot believe the price because I can match this up against my daughter\\'s brand new Samsung feature for feature.Came beautifully packaged and ready to go right out of the box. I took the card out of my old phone and popped it in and it was ready to go.If you\\'re on the fence do not hesitate. It is a beautiful phone and works like the most high-end brand.I love it!!!\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Wish I could give this zero stars.I was so excited upon receiving this phone as it\\'s such a good deal and seemed really good quality.A few days after good use, the phone started malfunctioning. It started freezing, and then shutting itself off saying \\\\\"this device is corrupted.\\\\\"And then turning itself back on and then freezing again and then repeating the process etc, over and over again.I\\'m so annoyed, now I won\\'t have a phone for another week.Unfortunately, this phone is a piece of garbage.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  This cell phone is the best I have ever had in my life. I used to have Samsung cell phone before years ago so as other brand name phones I\\'ve got from T-Mobile and these worked exactly for a year and were not usable right when the warranty was expiring.I got tired of this and bought my first  off-brand cell phone - ZTE ZMAX - it was a great phone for 2015, much better than Samsung I had prior to it for the fraction of the cost! It worked for 2 years until the battery got fully discharged and I wasn\\'t able to charge it ever again. I then bought Huawei Honor 6x and had it for 3 years. It worked just fine until it started acting with major delays, so I knew it was time to get a new phone.After multiple hours of research I decided to go with Remi Note 8. Thanks to \\\\\"frequency check\\\\\" site I knew I had to get a Global version. I highly recommend to check the phone model and your provider to see how many bands will be supported. I have T-Mobile and any International Version of this phone wasn\\'t working for T-Mobile LTE.Unfortunately Amazon didn\\'t have any Global versions of Redmi Note 8 in stock, so I wend with less memory and Redmi Not 8 Pro. It looks like I overpaid a little because overall prices were high (I blame coronavirus for that lol), but let me tell you - I didn\\'t regret my decision even once because Redmi Note 8 Pro is AMAZING!It feels great - solid, nice, works smooth! I just love it.It takes great pictures. Not as great (real looking) as my Canon Mark II takes, but much better than other phones. Selfies are also great.  The connection is the same as I had with Honor 6x (which supported more LTE bands by the way). I experienced a lost of connection while driving on Interstate as well as in multiple story office building, but it didn\\'t bother me as it happened few times really.The screen feels great to touch. The colors are amazing. Fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone works like a charm. Face recognition feature also works great. Fast browser. Battery life is also great, but my old Honor 6x was giving me full day of usage on one charge. I understand this phone is a huge upgrade from Honor 6x overall because it\\'s been 3 years between these phones which is a huge time frame in technical world, but Redmi Note 9 Pro amazes me every day and I am not even using it to full capacity.I\\'ve got 64 gb one as the price difference for about $45 between this and 128 gb didn\\'t do it for me. I am getting extra memory card which will last me for the duration of this phone\\'s life. After all my old Honor 6x had 32 gb and 64 gm external card and I still was good on memory after 3 years on regular usage.My only doubt is the color. I\\'ve got it in forest green and it\\'s beautiful, but I wanted it in white. Unfortunately the description for white didn\\'t indicate it\\'s a Global version so I wend with green. It still looks pretty cool! Included silicone cover is a bonus. My charger came without US adapter, so I ended up buying 2 for around $5 and now have capability of charging my phone super fast.If you still thinking of buying it... considering newer Redmi Note is about to be announced, don\\'t waste time - this phone is pretty amazing! Hoping it will last for few years.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Great phone for the price. At first I bought an Umidigi budget phone but that did not adequately meet my needs so it was returned. This phone has everything I need for the price. The only thing I took a star off was because the charger is European version and I really expected the phone to already have a screen protector installed like most budget or overseas unlocked phone. The one I got did not, and I don\\'t really feel like having to dish another $10 bucks or so to order a screen protector when the standard has been pre-installed on most or all phones like this. Maybe someone got lazy overseas and did not put one on but now I have to search for one on Amazon and hope that my screen will be okay in the meanwhile.The phone is fast, looks really amazing (I love the green color--I\\'ve never seen this color before on cellphones), and the MIUI is actually not bad even without an app drawer. I do have the Prime Nova Launcher already purchased so eventually I will revert to that launcher but right now just checking out Redmi\\'s MIUI for a feel of it. Right out of the box there was an update to 11 from 10 (I assume the MIUI update). It was a seemless update. So far the signal is good with TMobile for my area and multimedia like Netflix is really snappy and bright. The screen and ratio is good for videos. Haven\\'t tried the camera yet as I am not really a camera person. Will use it eventually and update my review overall in a few weeks or so.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  This phone is amazing for the price. The fingerprint reader is extremely snappy, scrolling is buttery smooth, and it\\'s lightning fast. Not to mention it\\'s a beautiful piece of tech. I got the green model. My service is with Cricket Wireless in rural Maryland and I\\'m getting all 5 bars of 4G LTE. I\\'m truly impressed by this phone and would recommend it to anyone looking for a $220 phone with $750 specs. I\\'m a happy camper.Update: After a few weeks using this phone I must say that it gets more amazing every day. I keep finding features while exploring the settings. I wasn\\'t expecting an app drawer but in the settings there is an app drawer option. I\\'m still a happy camper.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  First Chinese phone other than a flagship Samsung and iPhone in over 6 years. couldn\\'t be happier with this Redmi Note 8 Pro. Feels sleek in my hands, easy to navigate, not a ton of bloat ware, and battery lasts over 24 hours in between charges at least for the week I\\'ve had it.It\\'s running Android 9.0 and has already received 1 system update which is nice moving forward. The camera is better than my old Samsung Galaxy 8 which is saying quite a bit.The DDR is 6gb which is less than the newest Galaxy 10 at 8gb, but this phone is blazing fast. Definitely gonna stick with xiachow for future phones\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  First of all, I\\'m a huge Samsung fan. I have been buying Samsung\\'s Galaxy S series since S4. However, this highly anticipated s21 is a disappointment and actually a downgrade of last year\\'s s20 series. I prepurchased it and realized later that the specs are inferior to the previous version. Some of the specs I noticed include:1. Resolution dropped from QHD (3200 x 1440) to FHD (2400 x 1080)2. Ram dropped from 12GB to 8 GB3. MicroSD slot is gone4. Pressure testing shows that the new CPU Snapdragon 888\\'s performance is worse than last year\\'s 865\\'s performance. 888 consumes more battery life and gets heated easily.5. Case material of s21 also downgraded plastic6. Missing charger and headset in s21In summary, Samsung has downgraded its new s21 significantly but still with the same flagship price.  I would recommend that anyone that wants a Samsung phone buy the  s20 series.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  For the price you\\'d think you could get a charger, but no, you\\'ll have to go out and find one that has the right cable ends because this phone doesn\\'t use the same connections as the other phones we have.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  This phone has no aux/headphone jack.  Very disappointing. I paid over $700 for this phone. You would think it would have a headphone jack.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I like the phone itself but the battery does not last very long when it\\'s 100% and I\\'m not using it it will be down to like 92% when I go to use my phone and then it drops quickly when you make a phone call so I\\'m really disappointed with the battery.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Surprise on the quality of the phone. Great purchase\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Worked for the first week then black screen and couls not get powered back up.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Battery won\\'t last the whole day. Fingerprint recognition most of the time won\\'t work. Camera is also disappointing compared to what I know from Samsung. Memory is half full upon first use. Quite a disappointment.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Brand new out of the box, no issues so far. I\\'m upgrading from a 2017 Samsung J7 V so this is a decent upgrade for me. Does the job, Loving it so far. Battery life is comparable to my old phone, not bad. Face recognition and finger print scanner is awesome in my opinion, fast and easy. Again,I\\'m coming from an old model phone so these perks are all new to me. I\\'d say that it\\'s worth the money for sure.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  My experience with purchasing this phone, I was skeptical prior to buying it through Amazon.

For those on a budget, this phone is great! Just keep your expectations reasonable and  know what you are getting, as it is only Gorilla Glass 3 , not water resistant, and not as fast as say a Pixel 4A or OnePlus bigger flagship phones.

I have included the 3D Mark Benchmarks for Slingshot and Slingshot Extreme for those interested in raw power / numbers.

You haven\\'t been scammed if you don\\'t find the wired headphones  in the box!Original review: I say it\\'s the best, with a grain of salt, read the cons to know why!To start off, Samsung did an amazing job with this phone, so much that they rendered the fairly new, still very expensive, S20 Ultra, almost obsolete!But I\\'m not gonna review both units here, so for those of you looking for quick pros & cons, here you go.Pros:- AMAZING display, I had so many high end phones, including the IPhone 11 pro max and Google Pixel 4XL & even the note 10, but this screen here bests all of them. The high refresh rate, the beautiful colors, and the better ratio (it\\'s a little wider than the S20 ultra for example), all this makes for an outstanding screen.- Great main camera. The pictures are just perfect in almost all light conditions. I dunno how much better is the 108 MP mode, it bothered me a little that cropping a 108 MP picture didn\\'t yield the perfect result, but all in all, the camera is top notch, in all its modes. The videos are even better. You won\\'t find a phone with a better main camera on the market.- The S pen is pretty useful for taking notes! I didn\\'t feel like I needed it for anything else except, may be, for a selfie, so eventhough it isn\\'t the biggest selling point, it\\'s worth mentioning.- It looks great! Yup, design wise, that phone looks really good, that it feels bad putting any covers on it. I personally just ordered a very slim, transparent case & I wouldn\\'t recommend anything else.There are some added gimmicky features that you can find almost everywhere online, but I personally loved the direct share, where I can show anything I want from my phone and cast it to a smart TV or one with a Google chrome cast attached to it, it happened a lot before that I needed to show many people at the same time, whatever it is that was on my phone, photos or a certain app, and that feature here makes it so easy.Cons:- I dunno how this isn\\'t mentioned anywhere, but the selfie camera isn\\'t great at all in low light conditions. Yes in the morning, outdoor, it is very good, but other than that it\\'s just not great! I could see myself buying the next Google Pixel instead, just for this.- Battery life isn\\'t good enough either. It\\'s worse than my S20 Ultra, and it was no surprise, since Samsung decided to give this phone a smaller battery \\\\ud83d\\\\ude44I find myself charging it twice a day, which really isn\\'t practical.Just for those 2 points, added to the fact that it\\'s a super expensive phone, I had to give it 4 stars.Now if it gets the Google Pixel software for the selfie camera, and a full day of battery life that would have been the best phone ever made! But I guess we\\'ll have to wait for next year for that!\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  To preface this, I am being forced to purchase a new device as all US networks are apparently no longer supporting Huawei devices in the very near future. I decided to give the Note a try as it seemed that it would keep up with my daily usage for work and I\\'ve always desired having the S pen.I\\'ve been using this phone for a few days now and it is soooooo slow. Apps and Google searches take way too long to load. Hotspot is just downright awful. Battery life is sub par. Fast charging is much slower than what I had. Camera doesn\\'t quite compare to my old phone\\'s Leica camera, which I figured it wouldn\\'t. Not sure what kind of scam this is but I\\'m definitely returning it. Also didn\\'t come with earbuds or the phone clone connector. Don\\'t get me wrong, the phone looks great. The S pen was everything I was hoping for. The screen is spectacular and super bright. The 120hz refresh rate was cool for maybe the first 10 sec, then I realized it was a pretty worthless feature. Scrolling to the end of long page in a few seconds does me no good when I\\'m trying to read posts or search for information on that page.I went to AT&T to get my phone diagnosed. He tested it against his Note 20 Ultra and his phone ended up being twice as fast as mine running the same speed test, on the same network, on the same unlimited plan... all after my device took an additional 10-15 sec to connect before even starting the test.My advice, don\\'t waste your money. Just because Samsung markets like crazy doesn\\'t mean their phones are any good. For a flagship device and the price point, this phone falls well short of being worth it. I came from a two year old Huawei Mate 20 Pro and it\\'s sad that Samsung can\\'t make a phone that is able to compete with it. Not what I expected for my first Note phone. I\\'ve never been a Samsung hater by any means, but this experience just solidifies my previous viewpoint to never buy a Samsung device. Won\\'t make that mistake again.Update:I made that mistake again... In my defense, I was hoping this was an isolated incident or just a simple case of a bad device. I ordered another unlocked Note 20 Ultra from Best Busy to compare. Unfortunately for me, it was not. That device had all the same issues. Slow network speeds with AT&T (I live in a major city so this shouldn\\'t happen, period). This phone also didn\\'t come with earbuds so it seems like Samsung is just getting cheap on consumers.I tried swapping the SIM card with my girlfriend\\'s S20 and it still didn\\'t work. All calls were sent directly to voicemail and text messages were very hit or miss. AT&T had no idea, but I\\'m sure it was out of the hourly employees realm to troubleshoot. I had to switch back to my Huawei Mate 20 Pro. After 10 min or so I got a couple delayed text messages that were sent days ago in response to a text I originally sent from the Note 20 Ultra. SMH...I\\'m just downright confused at this point. Not sure whether it\\'s an issue with the device or with the 5G network, or both. You also can\\'t change which network bands you want to use, ie. turn 5G off. You can only toggle 2G on and off. My buddy has full control with his Note 10+ which is really mind boggling. Either way, both phones have been returned.I\\'m self-employed and my phone is my lifeline. I don\\'t have time to play these games or wait for Samsung to release an update. Such a shame because I really wanted to like this phone and I loved the S pen so far. Samsung just has a history of not being able to meet my expectations. The even bigger shame is that I can\\'t upgrade to better Huawei device...\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\u00a0I got this on launch day and it had a defect where the S pen wasn\\'t registering in a large circular area on the screen. Amazon sent me a replacement and it had the exact same failure. I\\'m done with it. I\\'ve had 2 other notes in the past and loved them, but having this almost $1500 phone fail right out of the box is where my love of the Note ends.IMPORTANT EDIT:  I Noticed this same issue occurring with my Note 10+ after I returned this phone (twice). This phenomenon was being caused by a Steelie magnetic mount on the back of the case. So if you are using a magnetic mount or have the phone close to a magnetic field, you will encounter this exact same issue.I have changed the review score to reflect this new information.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Purchased new phone, arrived damaged. Deceptively packaged with screen protectors. Pay very close attention to the device you receive.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I do not recommend buying.  the charger stopped working after just 2 hours of use.  and did not bring the headphones.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  The cameras, the S-pen, the AMOLED screen quality, the 120 Hz refresh rate, the 5G data connection, the build quality, etc. are all top notch. This phone will probably hold the crown for best Android phone for a good while, and it has key feature bumps that made me especially want this phone--namely the 5G and the 120 Hz screen.I would definitely recommend a solid case if you\\'re planning to spend this much money on a phone. I bought a Spigen case which effectively reduces the camera bump on the back to allow the phone to sit flat on a desk. The IP68 rating means that it will be fine with water and dust, but drop protection is still a must. I saw a stat recently that something like 2/3 of people report incurring drop damage to their phone (for all phones not specifically this phone).Other thoughts: I think it\\'s interesting that most middle class people can afford the best phone that you can possibly purchase for a product that is in your pocket, everyday, all the time. You can\\'t say that about cars, houses, clothes, but you could definitely swing buying the best phone that money can buy once every 3-4 years if it\\'s important enough to you. For me it is, and I\\'m very happy with this phone.Lastly: Google Pixel, 1+, Apple, etc. can only hope to match some of the features that this phone has to offer, but I highly doubt that they will exceed this phone\\'s specs on yet to be release products. Just my opinion as a phone guy, but the best that they could hope to do is give you a better value on specific features. If you\\'re somebody looking for the best value on a calling and texting machine, then this phone is not for you. This phone is for somebody that wants the best cameras, pocket computing power, & screen quality that money can buy you right now.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Whites are a bit dull not as bright as my note 10+ .poor battery life, takes too long to charge.

T-Mobile uses the following bands2, 4, 5, 12, 66, 71The A30s only supports band 5 from the that list!However, the A51 supports band 2, 4, 5, 12 and 66.  I was gladly willing to pay a little more to ensure I had maximum connectivity with my carrier so I cancelled the A30s and purchased the A51 instead.Now with that primary consideration out of the way, on to the rest of the review.  I\\'ll start with the best parts first.1.  Call quality, reception and connectivityThe call quality is excellent on this phone, right up there with my s10+.  I think the microphone quality has been improved because my wife loves using the speakerphone and on her hold s8+, her voice occasionally cut out here and there as the mic tried to pick up her voice.  Also, the sound quality of the voice has improved as well which further helps to understand the conversation.  Reception has been about the same compared to my s10+, which is to say pretty good.  We measured on signel strength and asu.  The mobile data speeds are excellent even in areas that are typically weaker in signal strength.2.  ScreenSamsung AMOLEDs are the best in the business when it comes to screen quality.  We are a little relieved the screen is not curved because this allows us to get a robust case to protect everything.  The colors, quality and resolution are all indistuingishable compared to my s10+.  The front camera is a tiny pinhole so the entire body is pretty much all screen.  There is an in-screen fingerprint reader which is optical, rather than infrasonic on my s10+ but it is still reasonably fast to unlock the phone.  Yes it is slightly slower than my s10+ but we\\'re talking milliseconds of difference.3.  General usabilityMy wife is not a gamer so I can\\'t say anything about the gaming experience but she does use a ton of media and productivity apps.  For all of her use on them so far, she says they feel snappy.  They all open fast and transition well and she multitasks as much as before without a shred of difference.  When we first setup the phone, we were concerned because there was some UI lag but realized a lot of processing was being used during the Samsung Switch, which transfered her entire old phone to the new phone.  Once the switch was done, we rebooted and the phone was responsive and fast.4.  CameraThe camera hardware has some beefy specs.  But for a mostly point-and-shooter, it\\'s hard to really go wrong many camera setups.  Picture quality looks great in the light and not as good in the dark compared to my s10+.  The slower camera speed is noticeable, transitioning between the main camera/wide/macro takes about a half second, where on my s10+ is pretty much instant.  The shutter is just as fast, luckily.  If camera speeds are important to you, you would probably not be happy with this phone.5.  BatteryI have to admit, we were looking forward to getting more usable time out of the battery.  The battery is 4000mah unit and the s8+ was only 3500mah.  However, through the typical daily use, we found that the end-of-day percentage left were about the same.  We average about 4 hours of on-screen time scattered throughout the day with app use and web-browsing and the battery was around 40% left, which is the same as the s8+.  If long battery life is important to you, you would not be happy with this phone but keep in mind, it can easily last an entire busy day on a single charge.Overall, we like the phone for the price of under $300.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  LTE working on T-Mobile in US with Mint mobile, after configuring APN!Great budget phone with a fantastic screen and pretty decent camera, and enough ram for the typical person.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I researched this exact model and every website says that this model comes with NFC, but it doesn\\'t. I noticed a customer ask the question if this model has NFC and it seems it was the seller who said it does have NFC. This phone is an international phone and it has some things in the settings that are in Spanish when I chose \\\\\"English\\\\\" in the setup. This phone also came with Android Auto preinstalled, but there is no way to open the app. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn\\'t help either. Not pleased that this phone doesn\\'t have NFC and the fact it has software bugs and it cost me $300 before tax. There are other phones out there for a lower price and even better specs. Not sure if will buy another Samsung phone after this experience.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I\\'m happy with my purchase however I received the wrong color I ordered the black one but I do find the blue pretty so I\\'ll be keeping it...phone works excellent on cricket wireless in Pennsylvania...I will recommend this phone.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  After learning about the A51 differences I would like to say that model SM-A515F/DS has 128GB internal storage, 4GB of RAM and doesn\\'t have NFC setting. Model SM-A515F/DSN has 128GB internal storage, 6GB of RAM and has the NFC setting.I purchased the Samsung Galaxy A51 Prism Crush Black phone April 27, 2020 and two days later the phone was at my doorstep (just the phone). The box came in completely sealed and it had all the accessories. After going through all the configuration (I did not setup fingerprint or face recognition at the beginning) I was in business. The colors on the Samsung Galaxy A51 are amazing. I did make a change under Settings > Display > Screen Mode, from Natural to Vivid and turn on Dark Mode. The fingerprint is under Settings > Biometrics and Security > Fingerprints. It took me a while to be able to setup fingerprint. Honestly did it like 30 times until it read 100%. You will have to move the finger to different angles until it reads your fingerprint completely. Every time it reads new lines the percentage goes higher. Once I was done, I tested it and it worked fine. I used all other 9 fingers different angles to see if it would let me login, and it DID NOT. The phone does take great pictures. I tested the macro on one of my dogs nose and WOW, the pic was stunning. The pic of a lizard was taken in macro. Calls are clear and it shows LTE with strong signal.  I am registered with MetroPCS and my dad with AT&T. I used my dad\\'s AT&T sim card and it worked (picture shows Metro by T-Mobile, AT&T).The phone does have 4GB of RAM. When I purchased mine the price had drop to the point I couldn\\'t pass it. I didn\\'t see anything on Amazon page at that time, but I don\\'t care, I\\'m very happy with the phone.Aside from the A51, I purchased a Feitenn Samsung Galaxy A51 Metal Case (ASIN B0839C38GM). The case is sturdy and it DOES protect the phone. The screen protector IS NOT attached (together) to the metal case like it shows on the pictures, and the screen protector IS NOT gorilla glass, it is just regular and it doesn\\'t have the whole for the front camera. I placed an order for 3 Tempered Glass (ASIN B082S7NCB8).Thanks\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Got the phone, 4 gig ram, might not be a such thing as 6 gig .

But so far happy with the phone. I use cricket as my carrier and was able to put my sim card in and it read it right away. I\\'m getting decent service on the phone better than what I did with my previous phone. I like how light the phone feels, it also fits well in my hands for texting and calling.

I messed up so many sales and lost so much in stocks till I found out...Also its full of ads and has spyware.. google redmi spyware and you will see for yourself.I will not be keeping it due to this as well.Not a bad phone for the price after 2 days use.Cameras are subpar. not sure why they went with 4 mediocre cameras instead of just 1 good one....not bad but not great by any means.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I bought this phone to replace my pixel 2xl that the camera stopped working on me. I spent days reading watching YouTube videos and settled for this phone. I knew not all the reviews were positive but figured the features on this phone looked great. I got it set up with Google Fi and it works fine. Battery last all day. Plenty of space but I am planning to get a SD card and add 256mb more. I was disappointed with the 64 gb camera the colors are just not vivid and life like the detail is there. That being said the regular camera mode takes much better pictures and I even used the macro camera to take some good shots. Night mode is nothing like my pixel. But you can still make your pictures look better by using Google photos app. The green color is beautiful and phone feels solid. I found a full cover case that uses magnets to seal itself. There is three different options for how to view the screen with the notch. I prefer to take it out the screen is huge so you don\\'t lose much. Also I already got the update to the latest operating software version from Redmi version 11. Overall I think is a great phone and the features are awesome at the price point.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  So I bought this phone after roughly three months of searching for a new daily driver. I activated it on MetroPCS, they gave me a little trouble saying it might not work, but after the $15 Sim swap it works no problem. The camera quality is honestly the best I\\'ve had. I bought this phone to replace my aging Huawei honor 7X. The battery life is great. I wake up at 6 a.m. with it fully charged and the battery is at about 75% when I get home at 4 p.m. with pretty heavy use. It\\'s currently at 57% at 9:20 p.m. the entire OS is snappy and responsive but the first thing I did is install Nova launcher and the HIDDEN MIUI SETTINGS app from the play store. Ads only appear in their MI APPS which I don\\'t touch. Cellular service was good, not the best. It\\'s better than my honor 7X. But Wi-Fi is damn impressive. 5 gigahertz next to my router gives me 340 megabytes down and 20 megabytes up, which for the most part is capping out my speed. The phone feels solid in the hand, but you can definitely tell the border is plastic. I\\'m glad that it supports an SD card, and as a bonus I found out that it also supports OTG which is a huge plus in my opinion. 6 days inn in the phone is working flawless and I couldn\\'t be happier. Hope this review helps\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  There are so many good reviews for this phone. Too many somehow.It is relatively cheap and offers a lot for the price. Their version of the Android user interface is actually very good.But there are too many negative things that convinced me that my first try of a Chinese brand, will also be the last. Battery life is average, for now. After only a few months of owning it I\\'ve noticed that the battery lasts less, compared to my old Samsung that I accidentally broke. The sensors are not very good, with the ambient light sensors outright not working.These are minor complaints though, I would still have given the phone 3 stars. But it seems that user privacy does not mean much for this company. The amount of bloatware in this phone is phenomenal. And none of the programs that Xiaomi kindly included only with the user\\'s benefit in mind, can be removed.I\\'ve owned and used various phones, LG, Samsung, iPhone, none of them had a specific user agreement for every piece of software that is on the device. Do you want to open the gallery app, you must first agree to sell all your data, including your soul I will assume, since the user agreement is the size of a book. Do you want to open the radio, music player, file explorer, you name it. For some reason everything has a user agreement. And everything has also advertisement, the chances of me buying a phone, browsing my contacts, watch my family photos, or open an app folder, just to also have random advertisements in there, are zero, I\\'d rather throw the phone away the same day.Doing a quick google search made me aware that actually Xiaomi has multiple problems when it comes to stealing user data and offloading it to servers abroad, and is a repeating offender also, meaning that they simply do not understand what the problem is. So I sat down and read some of the user agreements, specifically the one for the Phone Cleaner app they have pre-installed, and that you cannot remove from the phone. Why an application that is supposed to clean cached files, and empty the trash bin needs to be aware of my location, device identifiers, AND MESSAGES that I send? This specific application has been banned by multiple countries and has been proven to steal user data.I guess a good phone in a good price is not something we should expect at this day and age, it\\'s clear how Xiaomi plans to make a profit. And as I said I will switch to a new phone, and never again trust similar companies.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Great price for a incredible cell phone and works great with straight talk\\\\ud83d\\\\udc4d\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I love this phone, and I\\'ve had several American flagship phones that I\\'ve paid 1000$, and more dollars for. This phone has out performed them all for me. I\\'m still blown by the price vs quality of this phone, I\\'ve gotten 5 of them for my whole family, and have gotten a friend to get one for him, and his wife as well. I\\'m not a tech person, but as a regular user of the Camera, texting, data, gaming, social media, and streaming video, I\\'m in love with this phones quality, ability, and screen size, storage size, and user friendly interface. Not to mention the endless amount of really cool themes it gives you access to. Only downside, It was lightly dropped a very short distance while in a wallet case, and my screen now has a couple light cracks towards the middle of the right side of the screen, it bothers me that it\\'s there, but I\\'m still able to use my phone, so be very careful with it, otherwise these phones are spectacular!\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Best phone I ever had. Quality throughout. Levels above the Moto G power which I didn\\'t like at all because of its\\' poor display. This display while not amoled is one of the best LCD displays I\\'ve seen on a phone. Love the MIUI skin. Takes some getting used to but once you learn it you find it\\'s the best launcher out there. Lots of customization. Thank God for the app drawer option. Easy enough to get rid of bloatware and ad notifications and recommendations. Once that\\'s done you\\'re all set. Control center and notifications swipes are awesome.I\\'m in Florida and use Red Pocket GSMA sim which uses AT&T towers.  I get great LTE reception. This phone doesn\\'t come with Volte or wifi calling by default but if you do a little searching you will find that it is super easy to turn both on. I\\'m getting both on my phone. Also if you look search for a cell mapping website you will find which bands are used in your area. I have a little app the shows which bands I\\'m close to. AT&T uses 2,4,5,12, and 17 LTE bands. Most in my area and most of the states use 2.4 and 5 so I\\'m good. I don\\'t believe this phone has band 12 and 17even though the listing says it does but from my searching they aren\\'t used much. I\\'v been all over town and then some and I get great coverage everywhere. The phones radios are stronger than my last US phone. Just find the APN for your carrier. Just slipping the sim in won\\'t do. Get it configured  correctly. It\\'s not that hard.There is so much to love about. I\\'m a Xiaomi fan now and will be my go to company from now on. Moto\\'s look cheap by comparison. This is Samsung or above quality.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I bought this cellphone because the seller\\'s description says \\\\\"Unlocked\\\\\" and \\\\\"Global\\\\\" but unfortunately it isnt. This cellphone dosen\\'t work for Argentina 4G. Please check before you buy it. I tried with Movistar, Claro and Tuenti.I am sure the cellphone is good but with the 4G problem is like buying a tablet. Again please check the 4G bands before you buy a cellphone and ask as many questions as you can to the seller and also Amazon\\'s experts.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Beautiful phone with premium feel, however I am not able to receive calls at home due to poor signal a problem I never had with my old phone. I\\'m thinking of returning the phone and the accessories.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I will only point out what I like and don\\'t like.Lots of bloatware to remove.Not too much choice for cases, just about 5 to 10 on Amazon.Easy 2 to 3 days battery life, from 100% to 35%, then time to recharge.I don\\'t have to keep on cleaning the screen as my finger prints don\\'t show much on the screen.Even with a bunch of apps, the phone is extremely quick.It works perfectly with my Mavic Mini (DJI drone), and the screen can be very bright to see outside.If 128gb is not enough, you can always add a SD card.Sound is as loud as any other phone.Bluetooth can connect with all my oldest and newest accessories.I always use a DSLR for photo, but this phone makes some very good quality pictures for a phone, so I am now starting to use my phone to take more photos on the go.Over all, this phone is a power house, and an exceptional bargain considering the price.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  This is a widely known issue with no fix yet from the company.It does not notify you with updates from apps not installed on there originally.. like viber, ebay etc.I sell on ebay and trade stocks and did not realize i was not getting notifications. I messed up so many sales and lost so much in stocks till I found out...Also its full of ads and has spyware.. google redmi spyware and you will see for yourself.I will not be keeping it due to this as well.Not a bad phone for the price after 2 days use.Cameras are subpar. not sure why they went with 4 mediocre cameras instead of just 1 good one....not bad but not great by any means.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I bought this phone to replace my pixel 2xl that the camera stopped working on me. I spent days reading watching YouTube videos and settled for this phone. I knew not all the reviews were positive but figured the features on this phone looked great. I got it set up with Google Fi and it works fine. Battery last all day. Plenty of space but I am planning to get a SD card and add 256mb more. I was disappointed with the 64 gb camera the colors are just not vivid and life like the detail is there. That being said the regular camera mode takes much better pictures and I even used the macro camera to take some good shots. Night mode is nothing like my pixel. But you can still make your pictures look better by using Google photos app. The green color is beautiful and phone feels solid. I found a full cover case that uses magnets to seal itself. There is three different options for how to view the screen with the notch. I prefer to take it out the screen is huge so you don\\'t lose much. Also I already got the update to the latest operating software version from Redmi version 11. Overall I think is a great phone and the features are awesome at the price point.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  So I bought this phone after roughly three months of searching for a new daily driver. I activated it on MetroPCS, they gave me a little trouble saying it might not work, but after the $15 Sim swap it works no problem. The camera quality is honestly the best I\\'ve had. I bought this phone to replace my aging Huawei honor 7X. The battery life is great. I wake up at 6 a.m. with it fully charged and the battery is at about 75% when I get home at 4 p.m. with pretty heavy use. It\\'s currently at 57% at 9:20 p.m. the entire OS is snappy and responsive but the first thing I did is install Nova launcher and the HIDDEN MIUI SETTINGS app from the play store. Ads only appear in their MI APPS which I don\\'t touch. Cellular service was good, not the best. It\\'s better than my honor 7X. But Wi-Fi is damn impressive. 5 gigahertz next to my router gives me 340 megabytes down and 20 megabytes up, which for the most part is capping out my speed. The phone feels solid in the hand, but you can definitely tell the border is plastic. I\\'m glad that it supports an SD card, and as a bonus I found out that it also supports OTG which is a huge plus in my opinion. 6 days inn in the phone is working flawless and I couldn\\'t be happier. Hope this review helps\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  There are so many good reviews for this phone. Too many somehow.It is relatively cheap and offers a lot for the price. Their version of the Android user interface is actually very good.But there are too many negative things that convinced me that my first try of a Chinese brand, will also be the last. Battery life is average, for now. After only a few months of owning it I\\'ve noticed that the battery lasts less, compared to my old Samsung that I accidentally broke. The sensors are not very good, with the ambient light sensors outright not working.These are minor complaints though, I would still have given the phone 3 stars.
